Hi,

I'm working on a silly app and I need help to translate the text in the app to russian and I was hoping that you could help me with that! 
Credits will be listed on the google play page if you want that.

Strings that I need help to translate:
"Who's a millionaire?"
"Am I a millionaire?"
"I'm a MILLIONAIRE!"
"I have 1$!"
"I'm not a millionaire."
"Input how much money you have"
"Tell your friends!"

I attached some screen shots of what the app looks like. The purpose of the app is to tell the user if they are a millionaire (in any currency listed in the app) and then allow posting to facebook and twitter  and g+ for bragging rights.

Br,

Carl
